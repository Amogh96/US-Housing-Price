# US-Housing-Price
A key motivating factor for forecasting house prices is the correlation between housing prices and the economy. House pricing measurements are not precise. In real estate deals, a property's worth is significant. In 2016, 560,000 homes were sold in the US, according to the US Census Bureau (Number of new houses sold in the U.S. 2021 | Statista, 2022). Additionally, in 2016 [2], 65% of all American families owned a home. The fact that there are numerous variables that might affect a home's potential price makes it more difficult for an individual to determine a home's value on their own without the assistance of a professional. As a result, individuals may end up poorly making decisions on the sale or purchase of their homes as well as what prices are fair. It is crucial that consumers make decisions based on the most accurate information available because homes are long-term investments. A good property price forecast would better prepare the Americans who sold and bought these homes for what to anticipate before they made one of the most significant financial decisions of their life. Numerous factors, including average area population, average area income, number of bedrooms, and average area house age, influence house pricing. These inquiries serve as a roadmap for this task: Which characteristics are crucial for estimating house prices.
